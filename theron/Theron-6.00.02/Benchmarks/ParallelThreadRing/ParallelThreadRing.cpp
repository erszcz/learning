// This benchmark implements a variant on the "thread-ring" benchmark intended to
// measure the raw speed of message passing. In the traditional benchmark, a single
// "token" message is sent around a ring of connected actors. The token is an integer
// counter, and the counter is decremented with every hop. When the token value reaches
// zero the identity of the actor holding the token is printed out.
//
// Note that the processing within each actor is trivial and consists only of decrementing
// the value of the token it received in a message, and forwarding it to the next actor
// in the ring in another message. To form the ring, each actor is provided with the address
// of the next actor in the ring on construction.
//
// Unlike the standard benchmark, this variant creates 503 tokens instead of just one.
// Each of the actors in the ring is passed one token initially. As before, the tokens
// are passed around the ring and decremented with each hop until they reach zero. The
// waiting main program terminates when it has received all of the replies, indicating
// all the tokens have reached zero. The total number of "hops" to be performed is split
// equally between the 503 tokens, so that between them they perform the intended number
// of hops, but in parallel.
//
// This benchmark is a more severe (and arguably more meaningful) measure of the raw
// performance of an Actor Model implementation, since it involves parallel message
// passing and so contention over the shared components of the message passing mechanism.
// It's execution times show a lot of variability, presumably because the execution order
// (the order in which the actors are processed) is non-deterministic and can vary from
// one run to the next.
