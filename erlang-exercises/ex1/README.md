# Multiples of 3 and 5

Let's take a sequence from 1 to 100.
Print each number in the sequence on a separate line,
but for numbers divisible by 3 print "multiple of 3",
for numbers divisible by 5 print "multiple of 5",
and for numbers divisible by 3 and 5 print "multiple of 3 and 5."

For example:

```
1
2
multiple of 3
4
multiple of 5
multiple of 3
7
8
multiple of 3
multiple of 5
...
```
